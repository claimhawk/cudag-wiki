# Project Overview: `visualizer/docs`

## 1. Overview

The `visualizer/docs` project is a documentation and visualization layer for attention mechanisms, primarily designed to render and explain attention weights in neural networks (e.g., transformers) for educational, debugging, or analytical purposes. The core goal is to provide developers and researchers with an intuitive, interactive way to visualize attention patterns — such as which tokens influence which others — to better understand model behavior.

The project currently contains a single markdown file: `attention-visualization.md`, which appears to serve as the primary documentation or specification for how attention visualization should be implemented or interpreted. The presence of an error message — `Lookup failed for Cls 'DocGenerator' from the 'wiki-agent' app: App 'wiki-agent' not found` — suggests that this project may be intended to integrate with or be consumed by a larger system (possibly a wiki or documentation generator), but that system is not currently available or properly configured.

This project does not yet contain a fully functional visualization engine, but rather lays the groundwork for one, including documentation, potential API specs, and placeholder structure.

## 2. Architecture

The project is minimal and currently consists of only one file:

```
attention-visualization.md
```

This file is likely intended to serve as:

- A specification document for the visualization module.
- A guide for developers on how to interpret or implement attention visualization.
- A placeholder for future code generation or documentation rendering.

There are no directories, submodules, or code files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`) present at this time. The architecture is flat and documentation-centric. Future expansion may include:

- `src/` — for visualization logic and rendering components.
- `assets/` — for static resources (images, CSS, JS).
- `tests/` — for unit/integration tests.
- `config/` — for visualization settings or model configurations.

The current structure is not suitable for production use without significant expansion.

## 3. Key Components

### `attention-visualization.md`

This is the only component in the project. It likely contains:

- Descriptions of attention mechanisms (e.g., self-attention, cross-attention).
- Diagrams or pseudocode for visualizing attention matrices.
- Example outputs or expected formats for rendered visualizations.
- API or interface specifications for how visualization components should be invoked.
- Notes on integration with other systems (e.g., "This should be rendered by the wiki-agent app").

The error message `Lookup failed for Cls 'DocGenerator' from the 'wiki-agent' app` indicates that this file may be intended to be processed by a `DocGenerator` class in a hypothetical `wiki-agent` application — which is not currently installed or available. This implies the file may be meant to be parsed or rendered by a tool that is not part of this project.

## 4. Data Flow

Currently, there is no active data flow because no code is implemented. However, the intended data flow would likely be:

1. **Input**: An attention matrix (e.g., shape `[seq_len, seq_len]` or `[batch, seq_len, seq_len]`) generated by a transformer model.
2. **Processing**: The `attention-visualization.md` file would be used to define how this matrix should be rendered — e.g., via heatmap, bar chart, or interactive UI.
3. **Output**: A rendered visualization (e.g., HTML, SVG, PNG, or interactive web component).

In a future implementation, this might involve:

```python
# Pseudocode
attention_matrix = model.get_attention_weights()
visualizer = AttentionVisualizer(config)
visual_output = visualizer.render(attention_matrix)
```

The current state lacks the `AttentionVisualizer` class or any rendering logic.

## 5. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A working environment (e.g., virtualenv, conda)
- The `wiki-agent` app (if you intend to use the `DocGenerator` class — currently not available)
- Optional: Jupyter notebook or web server for previewing visualizations

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if hosted on GitHub or similar):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/visualizer.git
   cd visualizer/docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):

   Currently, no dependencies are specified. If you intend to extend this project, you may need to install:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision
   ```

3. **Run documentation preview** (if `wiki-agent` is available):

   ```bash
   # This will fail unless wiki-agent is installed
   python -m wiki_agent --render docs/attention-visualization.md
   ```

4. **Edit the documentation**:

   Open `attention-visualization.md` in your editor and update the content to reflect your desired visualization format, API, or examples.

5. **Develop visualization logic**:

   Create new files under `src/` or `visualizer/` to implement the actual rendering logic. For example:

   ```python
   # src/attention_visualizer.py
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np

   class AttentionVisualizer:
       def __init__(self, config):
           self.config = config

       def render(self, attention_matrix):
           plt.imshow(attention_matrix, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
           plt.colorbar()
           plt.title("Attention Matrix")
           plt.show()
   ```

---

## Next Steps

- Implement the `AttentionVisualizer` class and rendering logic.
- Add support for multiple visualization types (heatmap, bar chart, interactive).
- Integrate with model outputs (e.g., from Hugging Face Transformers).
- Fix or remove dependency on `wiki-agent` if not needed.
- Add tests and documentation for API usage.

This project is currently in early-stage documentation phase. It provides a foundation for future development of attention visualization tools.
